# HOLIDAY PROJECT: REDDIT 💀🧙‍♀️
Just imagine your holiday getting absolutly ruined by a massive project. A nightmare right? that's what we've been through. (jk I started the project two days ago and nailed my holiday haha) well actually I didn't do that either but the point is holiday was a nightmare.
Anyway I lost the topic, this a really bad kinda-failed but-still-amazing simulation of the always-trigger-warning Reddit app. We tried and that matters. And I really got the whole OOP thing now.

## What's Reddit? 🌚💣
fr? "Reddit is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and forum social network. Registered users submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members." said wikipedia.
But let me give you a better explanation. Reddit is thr coolest app that you can find any sort of community you're looking for and join them and view posts and pics and videos in them with no limit. yeah trigger warning was for that.
and these days that all platforms had gotten rid of the dislike buttom, I love Reddit's downvote. Freedom guys we can have opinion!
It's just a good app with good people of anykind mostly because of the seperated communities and the fact that users don't get mixed and everything's peaceful.

## Description 🎃🕹
First of all this project is not the reddit I excitingly told you about. It's a simulation as I told you. And an app is nothing without the users and data made by the users in it and this project has neither of them so you can see how incomplete it is.
But you can sign in and make an account and post stuff in it. you can do most of the things you are capable of in the actual Reddit app(just in a lower quality).
The main purpose of this project wasn't making a whole Reddit app, it was to master OOP materials and slay the dragons of polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, and others. (which happened)
